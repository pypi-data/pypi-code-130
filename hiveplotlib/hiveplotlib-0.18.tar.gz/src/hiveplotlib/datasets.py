"""
Quick example datasets for use in ``hiveplotlib``.

For Hive Plots, many excellent network datasets are available online, including many graphs that can be generated using
`networkx <https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generators.html>`_ and the
`Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection <https://snap.stanford.edu/data/>`_. If working with ``networkx`` graphs,
users can also take advantage of the ``hiveplotlib.converters.networkx_to_nodes_edges()`` method to quickly get those
graphs into a ``hiveplotlib``-ready format.

For Polar Parallel Coordinates Plots (P2CPs), many datasets are available through packages including
`statsmodels <https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/datasets/index.html>`_ and
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html>`_.
