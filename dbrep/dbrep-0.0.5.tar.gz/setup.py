It is the simplest EL-tool.\n\n## What it is NOT\n- It is NOT orchestrator. You may use existing one, like Airflow, Prefect or Dagster.\n- It is NOT data transformation tool. You may use DBT or others.\n- It is NOT data ingestion tool -- it won't grab data from external resources.\n\n## Distinctive features\n### Simple\nIt does not try to solve miriad of problems, but nicely fits into existing data-engineering stack with (airflow, dbt and other tools).\n\n### Stateless\nIt does not store state of jobs or tables, besides connection configs.\n\n### Robust\nSince it is stateless there is only a handful of things that could go wrong.\n\n### Type-aware\nTypes are not lost in translation. I.e. if it was a *number(10,0)* in Oracle, it won't suddenly become a *Float64* in ClickHouse.",
