Helpful for searching\n     articles.\n\n** HTTP integration with DBLP and ArXiv\n   - Supports multiple parallel requests for batch updates\n\n** Fetch PDF from a given URL\n   - Easier to fetch using python than with Emacs's callbacks\n\n** Option for proxying requests\n   - Particularly useful for PDFs if you're tunneling to your institution from\n     home or some other location and the article you want is with institutional\n     (IP based) access only.\n\n* Roadmap\n\n** More Tests\n   - Coverage is low.\n   - Need to remove some code which isn't used.\n   - Some parts need to be rewritten.\n\n** Change to new Semantic Scholar API (*Done*)\n   Semantic Scholar is changing its API. See https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api\n   we should migrate to new ~graph/v1/paper~ API.\n\n** Integrate ~common_pyutil.net.Get~\n   It has support for progress tracking. Helpful when network is slow and when\n   downloading large files.\n\n** ASGI server\n   With websockets for better Async integration.\n\n** Integrate more services\n   There're semi-working/broken functions for CrossRef and some other services in\n   ~ref-man~. They can be exported to python perhaps.\n\n* Wishlist\n\n** Serve Org files on the fly as html\n   Will help in integrating a larger userbase. Perhaps also with a py-to-lisp\n   (hy like maybe) interface so that elementary scripting on the org backend can\n   be done.\n\n** Ultimately integrate ~pndconf~ also\n   A document preparation toolchain (See https://github.com/akshaybadola/pndconf),\n   which is integrated with ~ref-man~.\n\n* License\n\n  All the code in this repo except for external services and libraries are\n  licensed under AGPL 3.0 (or later).
