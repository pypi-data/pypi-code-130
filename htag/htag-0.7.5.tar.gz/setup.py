(not starlette!)\n * ~~I don\'t really like the current way to generate js in interaction : need to found something more solid.~~\n * ~~the current way to initiate the statics is odd (only on real (embedded) Tag\'s) : should find a better way (static like gtag ?!)~~\n\n\n## History\n\nAt the beginning, there was [guy](https://github.com/manatlan/guy), which was/is the same concept as [python-eel](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel), but more advanced.\nOne day, I\'ve discovered [remi](https://github.com/rawpython/remi), and asked my self, if it could be done in a *guy way*. The POC was very good, so I released\na version of it, named [gtag](https://github.com/manatlan/gtag). It worked well despite some drawbacks, but was too difficult to maintain. So I decided to rewrite all\nfrom scratch, while staying away from *guy* (to separate, *rendering* and *runners*)... and [htag](https://github.com/manatlan/htag) was born. The codebase is very short, concepts are better implemented, and it\'s very easy to maintain.\n\n\n',
