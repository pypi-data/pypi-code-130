    Args:
        runs: A list of runs or run names to stop. Using ``Run`` objects is most
            efficient. See the note below.
        timeout: Time, in seconds, in which the call should complete. If the call
            takes too long, a TimeoutError will be raised. If ``future`` is ``True``, this
            value will be ignored.

            call to `stop_runs` will return immediately and the request will be
            processed in the background. This takes precedence over the ``timeout``
            argument. To get the :type Run: output, use ``return_value.result()``
            with an optional ``timeout`` argument.

    Raises:
        KubernetesException: Raised if stopping any of the requested runs failed. All
            successfully stopped runs will have the status `RunStatus.STOPPED`. You can
            freely retry any stopped and unstopped runs if this error is raised due to a
            connection issue.

    Note:
    The Kubernetes API requires the platform for each run. If you provide ``runs`` as a
    list of names, we will get this by calling `get_runs`. Since a common way to get the
    list of runs is to have already called `get_runs`, you can avoid a second call by
    passing the output of that call in directly.
