## Typing stubs for pytz

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `pytz` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `pytz`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/pytz. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `80ce12e2954b3f4e9f8a843c6121985c8e9fc25c`.
